    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The actual current stack-top is always occupied by the previously pushed data. So, the push operation decrements SP by 2 and then stores the two bytes contents of the operand onto the stack.

   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: After the execution of the ISR, the control must go to the previous program (maybe main program) which was being executed. To execute it, IRET is placed at the end of ISR.

    1. The serial communication is
    <br/>
    a) cheaper communication
    <br/>
    b) requires less number of conductors

   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The serial communication requires less number of conductors and thus it is cheaper. It is slow as the bits are transmitted one by one along with start, stop and parity bits.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. The serial communication is used for
    <br/>
    a) short distance communication
    <br/>

    c) short and long distance communication
    <br/>
    d) communication for a certain range of distance
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Serial communication is more popular for communication over longer distances as it requires less number of conductors.

    <br/>
    d) all of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The mcs 51 architecture supports simultaneous transmission and reception of binary data byte by byte i.e. full duplex mode of communication. It supports serial transmission and reception of data using standard serial communication interface and baud rates.

    <br/>
    c) transceiver rate
    <br/>
    d) baud rate
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Here, baud rate can be defined as the number of bits transmitted or received per second.

   <p>
    5. The task of converting the byte into serial form and transmitting it bit by bit along with start, stop and parity bits is carried out by
    <br/>
    a) reception unit
    <br/>
    b) serial communication unit
    <br/>
    c) transmission unit
    <br/>
    d) all of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: the serial communication unit consists of transmission unit and reception unit. The task of converting the byte into serial form and transmitting it bit by bit along with start, stop and parity bits is carried out by transmission unit.
   </div>

    b) SBUF register
    <br/>
    c) SFR address
    <br/>
    d) Any of the mentioned
    <br/>
