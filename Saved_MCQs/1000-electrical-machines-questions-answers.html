    10. It is impossible to start a differential compounded dc motor.
    <br/>
    a) True
    <br/>
    b) False
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: It is so because of the unstable speed and torque characteristics. At starting, armature current and series field current are high. Since the series flux subtracts from shunt flux, series flux actually reverses the magnetic polarity. This motor will typically be still or turn slowly in wrong direction while burning up because of excessive current.

    7. For a three phase induction motor, maximum torque is double the full load torque and starting torque is 1.6 times the full load torque. To get a full load slip of 5%, percentage reduction in the rotor resistance should be?
    <br/>
    a) 62.7%
    <br/>
    b) 75%
    <br/>
    c) 60%
    <br/>
    d) 35%
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Slip at which maxim torque occurs is calculated as smT=0.5.
    <br/>
    r2/x2=0.5
    <br/>
    for full load slip of 0.05,  1/2 = 2/((0.05/sf)+(sf/0.05))
    <br/>
    smT2 = 0.186
    <br/>
    reduction in resistance = (0.5×2-0.186×2)/0.5×2 = 63%.

    13. The tappings on the transformers is provided on __________
    <br/>
    a) h.v side at one end of the winding
    <br/>
    b) l.v. side at one end of the winding
    <br/>
    c) h.v side at middle
    <br/>
    d) l.v side at middle
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: High voltage side winding has more voltage so the variation of the voltage will be more and better applicable. And it is better to place at the middle because it gives uniform voltage distribution by eliminating axial forces.
   </div>
   <p>
    14. In a transformer, we place the tapping windings at the middle because __________
    <br/>
    a) of radial forces on the windings
    <br/>
    b) axial forces on the windings
    <br/>
    c) insulation level of the winding
    <br/>
    d) to provide a mechanical balance to the windings
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Due to two different voltages, different currents will flow in the windings and it will cause the axial forces due to currents interaction appear causing damage.
   </div>
   <p>
    15. When a transformer winding suffers a short circuit, then inter turns of the same winding experience ______ forces.
    <br/>
    a) an attractive
    <br/>
    b) a repulsive
