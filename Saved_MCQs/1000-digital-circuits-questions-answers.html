    <br/>
    d) (0.24040)8
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Converting decimal fraction into octal number is achieved by multiplying the fraction part by 8 everytime and collecting the integer part of the result, unless the result is 1.
    <br/>
    0.345*8 = 2.76                 2
    <br/>
    0.760*8 = 6.08                 6
    <br/>
    00.08*8 = 0.64                 0
    <br/>
    0.640*8 = 5.12                 5
    <br/>
    0.120*8 = 0.96                 0

    <sup>
     4
    </sup>
    + 1 * 2
    <sup>
     3
    </sup>
    + 0 * 2
    <sup>

    10. How many full adders are required to construct an m-bit parallel adder?
    <br/>
    a) m/2
    <br/>
    b) m
    <br/>
    c) m-1
    <br/>
    d) m+1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: We need adder for every bit. So we should need m bit adders. A full adder adds a carry bit to two inputs and produces an output and a carry. But the most significant bits can use a half adder which differs from the full adder as in that it has no carry input, so we need m-1 full adders and 1 half adder in m bit parallel adder.

   </div>
   <p>
    2. Why is the fan-out of CMOS gates frequency dependent?
    <br/>
    a) Each CMOS input gate has a specific propagation time and this limits the number of different gates that can be connected to the output of a CMOS gate
    <br/>
    b) When the frequency reaches the critical value the gate will only be capable of delivering 70% of the normal output voltage and consequently the output power will be one-half of normal and this defines the upper operating frequency
    <br/>
    c) The higher number of gates attached to the output the more frequently they will have to be serviced thus reducing the frequency at which each will be serviced with an input signal
    <br/>
    d) The input gates of the FETs are predominantly capacitive and as the signal frequency increases the capacitive loading also increases thereby limiting the number of loads that may be attached to the output of the driving gate

    <br/>
    d) Negligible
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Propagation delay refers to the time taken by the output to change it’s state when the input is altered. When the transistor goes into saturation from all inputs being high charge is stored in the base region. When it comes out of saturation (one input goes low) this charge has to be removed and will dominate the propagation time which results as a large propagation delay. Thus, it has small clock frequency.

    <br/>
    d) Half adders can handle only single-digit numbers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Half adders have only two inputs A and B. When we add two 4 bit binary number like 0001 and 0011, then half adder can not be used because if the first bit of both the numbers is 1, then the sum would be 0 and carry would be 1. But this carry can not be added with the second bits addition of the number. So, half adders are useless. But in full adders, one more carry input is present, so that, if carry of one stage is present, it can be added with the next stage as it is done in normal addition. So, therefore, full adders have a carry input capability.

    d) The minuend and subtrahend are both left in their original form
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: When performing subtraction by addition in the 2’s-complement system, the minuend is left in its original form and the subtrahend is changed to its 2’s-complement. It is then added to the minuend. If the result has carry, then it’s dropped and that’s the final answer. Else, if the result has no carry, then the result is again converted to it’s 2’s complement form and that’s the final answer with a ‘negative’ sign.

    6. What is the major difference between half-adders and full-adders?
    <br/>
    a) Full-adders are made up of two half-adders
    <br/>
    b) Full adders can handle double-digit numbers
    <br/>
    c) Full adders have a carry input capability
    <br/>
    d) Half adders can handle only single-digit numbers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Half adders have only two inputs A and B. When we add two 4 bit binary number like 0001 and 0011, then half adder can not be used because if the first bit of both the numbers is 1, then the sum would be 0 and carry would be 1. But this carry can not be added with the second bits addition of the number. So, half adders are useless. But in full adders, one more carry input is present, so that, if carry of one stage is present, it can be added with the next stage as it is done in normal addition. So, therefore, full adders have a carry input capability.

    2. One positive pulse with tw = 75 µs is applied to one of the inputs of an exclusive-OR circuit. A second positive pulse with tw = 15 µs is applied to the other input beginning 20 µs after the leading edge of the first pulse. Which statement describes the output’s relation with the inputs?
    <br/>
    a) The exclusive-OR output is a 20 s pulse followed by a 40 s pulse, with a separation of 15 s between the pulses
    <br/>
    b) The exclusive-OR output is a 20 s pulse followed by a 15 s pulse, with a separation of 40 s between the pulses
    <br/>
    c) The exclusive-OR output is a 15 s pulse followed by a 40 s pulse
    <br/>
    d) The exclusive-OR output is a 20 s pulse followed by a 15 s pulse, followed by a 40 s pulse
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: When both the input pulses are high or low X-OR output is low. But when one of the input is high and another is low or vice-versa, output is high. In this problem for the first 20uS one input is high and another is low. So, obviously output is a high. for next 15uS both the input is high so output is low and for remaining 40uS(75-20-15) first input is still high and second one is low so output is high.

    c) It is slow due to propagation time
    <br/>
    d) All of the Mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The main disadvantage in using this type of adders is that the time delay increases as for each adder to add the carry should be generated in the previous adder, and for that to add the carry from the one before is required. However, this disadvantage is taken care of in Carry Look Ahead adder in which the ripple carry is converted in such a way that the carry over a group of bits of the adder becomes 2-level logic.

    9. The main disadvantage of Manchester carry chain is ___________
    <br/>
    a) Ripple factor
    <br/>
    b) Propagation delay
    <br/>
    c) Capacitive load
    <br/>
    d) Both propagation delay and capacitive load
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Propagation delay is the measure of time taken by the output to go to the next state when the input is altered. One of the major downsides of the Manchester carry chain is that the capacitive load of all of these outputs, together with the resistance of the transistors causes the propagation delay to increase much more quickly than a regular carry lookahead.

    9. The carry propagation can be expressed as ________
    <br/>
    a) Cp = AB
    <br/>
    b) Cp = A + B
    <br/>
    c) All but Y0 are LOW
    <br/>
    d) All but Y0 are HIGH
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: This happens in parallel adders (where we try to add numbers in parallel via more than one adders). A carry propagation occurs when carry from one adder needs to be forwarded to other adder and that second adder is holding the computation (addition) because carry from first adder has not come yet. So, there is a slight delay for second adder and this is known as carry propagation.

    7. A J-K flip-flop with J = 1 and K = 1 has a 20 kHz clock input. The Q output is ________
    <br/>
    a) Constantly LOW
    <br/>
    b) Constantly HIGH
    <br/>
    c) A 20 kHz square wave
    <br/>
    d) A 10 kHz square wave
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The flip flop is sensitive only to the positive or negative edge of the clock pulse. So, the flip-flop toggles whenever the clock is falling/rising at edge. This triggering of flip-flop during the transition state, is known as Edge-triggered flip-flop. Thus, the output curve has a time period twice that of the clock. Frequency is inversely related to time period and hence frequency gets halved.

    2. A ripple counter’s speed is limited by the propagation delay of _____________
    <br/>
    a) Each flip-flop
    <br/>
    b) All flip-flops and gates
    <br/>
    c) The flip-flops only with gates
    <br/>
    d) Only circuit gates
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A ripple counter is something that is derived by other flip-flops. It’s like a series of Flip Flops. Output of one FF becomes the input of the next. Because ripple counter is composed of FF only and no gates are there other than FF, so only propagation delay of FF will be taken into account. Propagation delay refers to the amount of time taken in producing an output when the input is altered.
   </div>

    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Transitional state is given by (2
    <sup>
     n
    </sup>
    – 1). Since, it’s a 4-bit counter, therefore, transition states = 2
    <sup>
     4
    </sup>
    – 1 = 15. So, total transitional states are 15.

    1. A ripple counter’s speed is limited by the propagation delay of ____________
    <br/>
    a) Each flip-flop
    <br/>
    b) All flip-flops and gates
    <br/>
    c) The flip-flops only with gates
    <br/>
    d) Only circuit gates
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A ripple counter is something that is derived by other flip-flops. It’s like a series of Flip Flops. The output of one FF becomes the input of the next. Because ripple counter is composed of FF only and no gates are there other than FF, so only propagation delay of FF will be taken into account. Propagation delay refers to the amount of time taken in producing an output when the input is altered.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. A 5-bit asynchronous binary counter is made up of five flip-flops, each with a 12 ns propagation delay. The total propagation delay (tp(tot)) is ________
    <br/>
    a) 12 ms
    <br/>
    b) 24 ns
    <br/>
    c) 48 ns
    <br/>
    d) 60 ns
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since a counter is constructed using flip-flops, therefore, the propagation delay in the counter occurs only due to the flip-flops. Each bit has propagation delay = 12ns. So, 5 bits = 12ns * 5 = 60ns.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. A 4-bit ripple counter consists of flip-flops, which each have a propagation delay from clock to Q output of 15 ns. For the counter to recycle from 1111 to 0000, it takes a total of ________
    <br/>
    a) 15 ns
    <br/>
    b) 30 ns
    <br/>
    c) 45 ns
    <br/>
    d) 60 ns
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since a counter is constructed using flip-flops, therefore, the propagation delay in the counter occurs only due to the flip-flops. Each bit has propagation delay = 15ns. So, 4 bits = 15ns * 4 = 60ns.
   </div>
   <p>
    4. A ripple counter’s speed is limited by the propagation delay of __________
    <br/>
    a) Each flip-flop
    <br/>

    <br/>
    c) The flip-flops only with gates
    <br/>
    d) Only circuit gates
    <br/>

    5. What is the maximum delay that can occur if four flip-flops are connected as a ripple counter and each flip-flop has propagation delays of tPHL = 22 ns and tPLH = 15 ns?
    <br/>
    a) 15 ns
    <br/>
    b) 22 ns
    <br/>
    c) 60 ns
    <br/>
    d) 88 ns
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Maximum propagation delay is the longest delay between an input changing value and the output changing value. Hence, 22 * n = 22*4 (Since there are 4 FFs) = 88ns.
    <br/>

    6. The main drawback of a ripple counter is that __________
    <br/>
    a) It has a cumulative settling time
    <br/>
    b) It has a distributive settling time
    <br/>
    c) It has a productive settling time
    <br/>
    d) It has an associative settling time
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The main drawback of a ripple counter is that it has a cumulative settling time (i.e. another bit is transmitted just after one consequently).
   </div>
   <p>
    7. A 4 bit modulo-16 ripple counter uses JK flip-flops. If the propagation delay of each flip-flop is 50 nsec, the maximum clock frequency that can be used is equal to __________
    <br/>
    a) 20 MHz
    <br/>
    b) 10 MHz
    <br/>
    c) 5 MHz
    <br/>
    d) 4 MHz
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since a counter is constructed using flip-flops, therefore, the propagation delay in the counter occurs only due to the flip-flops. Each bit has propagation delay = 50ns. So, 4 bits or FFs = 50ns * 4 = 200ns. Clock frequency = 1/200ns = 5 MHz.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. As the number of flip flops are increased, the total propagation delay of __________

    <br/>
    c) Both ripple and synchronous counters remain the same
    <br/>
    d) Ripple counter remains the same but that of synchronous counter increases
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In ripple counter, the clock pulses are applied to one flip-flop only. Hence, as the number of flip-flops increases the delay increases. In the synchronous counter, clock pulses to all flip-flops are applied simultaneously.

    <br/>
    d) All of the Mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: A glitch is a transition that occurs before a signal settles to a specific value.

    <br/>
    a) Stable
    <br/>
    b) Unstable
    <br/>
    c) Saturated
    <br/>
    d) Both Stable &amp; Saturated
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Astable multivibrator, in which the circuit is not stable in either state i.e. it continually switches from one state to the other. It is internally triggered and does not have any stable state.
   </div>

    5. Monostable multivibrator is/has ________ state.
    <br/>
    a) Stable
    <br/>
    b) Unstable
    <br/>
    c) One stable and another unstable
    <br/>
    d) Independent
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Monostable multivibrator, in which one of the states is stable, but the other state is unstable (transient). A trigger pulse causes the circuit to enter the unstable state. After entering the unstable state, the circuit will return to the stable state after a set time.

    9. In an astable multivibrator, the amplifying elements are ____________
    <br/>
    a) FET
    <br/>
    b) JFET
    <br/>
    c) OP-AMP
    <br/>
    d) All of the Mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Astable multivibrators are made with FET, JFET, OP-AMP or other types of amplifier. Astable circuit continually switches from one state to the other. It keeps oscillating between unstable states.

    10. Monostable multivibrator can also be termed as ____________
    <br/>
    a) Full astable multivibrator
    <br/>
    b) Half astable multivibrator
    <br/>
    c) Half bistable multivibrator
    <br/>
    d) Full bistable multivibrator
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since, astable multivibrator is unstable and changes their states continually (It means that it can have both the states), whereas in monostable multivibrator, one of the states is stable, but the other state is unstable. SO Monostable Multivibrator is also known as Half-Astable Multivibrator.
