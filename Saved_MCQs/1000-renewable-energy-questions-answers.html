    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Optimal tip speed ratio is required to ensure maximum efficiency in converting wind energy to mechanical energy. If the propeller blades rotate too slowly, it allows too much wind to pass through undisturbed and does not extract sufficient energy. However, if the blades rotate too quickly, it creates a large amount of drag.

    <br/>
    c) Rotor blade shape profile
    <br/>
    d) Different types of gases
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Tip speed ratio depends on rotor blade shape and its wind profile. It also depends on the number of turbine blades and the design of the wind turbine propeller.
