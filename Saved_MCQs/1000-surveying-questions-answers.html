    d) 183.987
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Total error in latitude = -264.97 + 182.96 + 79.62 = -2.39
    <br/>
    Total perimeter of traverse = 125.91 + 198.57 + 229.88 = 554.36 m
    <br/>
    Sum of latitudes = 264.97 + 182.96 + 79.62 = 527.55
    <br/>
    Now, correction for latitude of BC = latitude of BC * total error in departure / sum of latitudes = 182.96 * (- 2.39) / 527.55 = – 0.829 m. If error is negative, correction is positive
    <br/>
    Corrected departure = 182.96 + 0.829 = 183.789.

    <br/>
    d) 47.6, 0
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: We know that, D = Ks + C, on substituting the values of D, s, C we get two equations. 50 = k(0.024) + C; 130 = k(0.824) + C. On subtracting, we get
    <br/>
    80 = k(0.8). We get, K = 100. Now, substitute this value in any of the equations to get the value of C. It can be given as 50 = 100*0.024 + C, C = 47.6.
