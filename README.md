You can change by passing `--workers {thread-choice}` .

More workers can cause unstability

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

to install requirements

LOG: This is getting traction hehe so gonna make it better to use and better at output

1. PDF Output instead of HTML or maybe optional idk
2. setup script so that installable from pip
3. good docs ðŸ’€
4. plain text output format with just questions and answers in txt. easier to "study" xD.
